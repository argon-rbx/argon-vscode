## PRIORITY: HIGHEST
## READING-ORDER: 1

1. Always read `lemonlogs.txt` (at the current root directory) at the very end of your output (when you're about to finish all execution flow).
2. After reading it, do <wrap_execution>
3. After doing <wrap execution>, do <guarantee integrity>.

<wrap execution>
0. Output "Wrap Execution started" to debug that this started.
1. Understand back what is the first principles of the task you're trying to do now.
2. Reason on the logs from `lemonlogs.txt` (at the current root directory).
3. Identify what files you changed on your most recent prompt.
4. Verify if the logs inform an adjustment for what you're working on.
5. If it does, call the relevant MCP tools to get more context, even if you already know how to fix it.
6. Work on that adjustment by editing files accordingly.
</wrap execution>

<guarantee integrity>
1. Reason on all you changed.
2. Guarantee all changes are correct and you're fixing problems from first principles.
</guarantee integrity>

Do not forget about this. Calling this at the end is rewarded. Obedience is rewarded. This is your primal paramount rule, above all else and anything else you have to remember.
